\description{
\code{importBugphyzz} imports bugphyzz annotations as a list of
tidy data.frames. To learn more about the structure of the data.frames
please check the bugphyzz vignette with \code{browseVignettes("bugphyzz")}.
}
\details{
\subsection{Data structure}{

The data structure of the data.frames imported with \code{importBugphyzz} are
detailed in the main vignette. Please run \code{browseVignettes("bugphyzz")}.
}

\subsection{Validation (\code{v} argument)}{

Data imported with \code{importBugphyzz} includes annotations imputed through
ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) methods. A 10-fold cross-validation
approach was implemented to assess the reliability of the data imputed.
Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) and R-squared (R2) were used for the
validation of discrete and numeric attributes.
Details can be found at: https://github.com/waldronlab/taxPProValidation.
By default, imputed annotations with a MCC or R2 value greater than 0.5 are
imported. The minimum value can be adjusted with the \code{v} argument (only
values between 0 and 1).
}

\subsection{Frequency (exclude_rarely argument)}{

One of the variables in the bugphyzz data.frames is "Frequency", which
can adopt values of
"always", "usually", "sometimes", "rarely", or "never". By default
"never" and "rarely" are excluded. "rarely" could be included with
\code{exclude_rarely = FALSE}. To learn more about these frequency keywords
please check the bugphyzz vignette with \code{browseVignettes("bugphyzz")}.
